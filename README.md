# SendingEmailUsingSelenium
The script for sending email. It worked before, now it's all red. Have to review.
When launching this project it has all email related fields in red and there are no suggestions given by IDE (Intelije) on how to fix it. It worked before though. There are 2 files POM (which has the dependency added for enabling sending email function) and the actual code for sending email.
